# Research-Plan-Implement (Cursor)

## Default workflow
- For non-trivial tasks, follow: **Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Save/Resume**.
- Prefer writing or updating durable artifacts in `thoughts/shared/`:
  - Research: `thoughts/shared/research/NNN_topic.md`
  - Plans: `thoughts/shared/plans/NNN_topic.md`
  - Sessions: `thoughts/shared/sessions/NNN_topic.md`
  - Cloud: `thoughts/shared/cloud/NNN_platform_environment.md`

## Use the repo slash commands
- Use the numbered Cursor slash commands:
  - `/1_research_codebase` (produce a research artifact)
  - `/2_create_plan` (produce an implementation plan)
  - `/4_implement_plan` (execute an approved plan phase-by-phase)
  - `/3_validate_plan` (verify plan success criteria + deviations)
  - `/5_save_progress` and `/6_resume_work` (checkpoint + resume)
  - `/7_research_cloud` (read-only)
  - `/8_define_test_cases` (comment-first DSL)

## Research behavior
- Read user-mentioned files first.
- Use codebase search to find entry points and call-sites.
- Prefer evidence: cite file paths + line ranges when making claims.

## Planning behavior
- Ask only questions that require human judgment.
- Write phased plans with measurable success criteria and explicit out-of-scope.

## Implementation behavior
- Do not implement until a plan is approved.
- Implement phase-by-phase; run the phase’s automated checks; fix failures before moving on.
- Update plan checkboxes as you complete work.

## Save/resume behavior
- If work is paused, produce a session summary with:
  - what changed, what’s next, what’s blocked, and how to resume.

## Safety
- For cloud analysis, execute READ-ONLY operations only; never create/update/delete resources.
